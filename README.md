# Parse-Web-data-with-Jsoup
The task aims to parse calendar data from a government website https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/labour-relations/public-holidays-western-australia

It was one of those tasks for a job interview

Oh, well. I didn't get the job despite completing it. I still did it though for the pursuit of knowledge and science.

Well, Jsoup connect may throw some SSL error if called from the website directly, so I parsed the website locally as html file if I have too.
